# Decentralized, Explainable, and Adaptive AI

**README**  
*Last Updated: 02/03/2025*

## Overview

Centralized AI systems often suffer from:

- **High Energy Consumption**  
- **Opaque, Black-Box Models**  
- **Data Monopolies & Bias**  
- **Limited Real-World Adaptability**

This project proposes a **Decentralized AI Network** that combines:
- **Blockchain** for transparent on-chain governance and reward distribution  
- **Federated Learning** for privacy-preserving model training  
- **Proof-of-Compute (PoC)** to incentivize participants who contribute computing resources  
- **White Box AI** methods for greater explainability and auditability  
- **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** for community-driven, ethical oversight

By aligning incentives through token-based economics and prioritizing explainability, we aim to foster an open, globally distributed ecosystem where AI models continuously evolve and remain transparent, trustworthy, and user-centric.

## Key Features

1. **Decentralized Training & Inference**  
   Replace massive, centralized data centers with a global network of nodes contributing compute power.

2. **Proof-of-Compute (PoC)**  
   Reward network participants for verified AI computation (training or inference tasks).

3. **Federated Learning with Privacy**  
   Sensitive data stays on local devices; only encrypted updates or gradients are shared.

4. **White Box AI / Explainability**  
   Real-time interpretability tools, on-chain decision logs, and modular neural-symbolic approaches.

5. **DAO Governance**  
   Open governance for protocol upgrades, ethical policy decisions, and dispute resolution.

6. **Bias Mitigation**  
   Continuous feedback loops and multi-modal real-world data to minimize harmful biases.

1. **User Devices** gather real-world data and train locally, respecting user privacy.  
2. **Decentralized AI Network** processes tasks (e.g., training, inference) via Proof-of-Compute (PoC), redistributing rewards.  
3. **Blockchain Layer** handles governance, security, and immutability (e.g., storing model hashes, decision logs).  
4. **Decentralized Storage** ensures global redundancy and tamper-proof data references.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

- **Smart Contracts**  
  Install the necessary dependencies for your chosen blockchain environment.  

- **AI Components**  
  Set up a Python environment (or relevant framework) and install all required libraries for model training.

### Configure Environment

- Copy or rename your sample environment file (e.g., `.env.example`) and update variables for your blockchain node, wallet keys, or other credentials.

### Deploy Smart Contracts

- Compile and deploy your smart contracts to the desired network.  
- Ensure your deployment workflow is configured for the specific blockchain environment (local or public testnet).

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Network**  
   Launch or connect to your local/test blockchain network, then deploy contracts accordingly.

2. **Start Federated Learning**  
   Use your AI components to train locally on a dataset of your choice. Federated learning can be enabled by configuring device-to-network communication and securely aggregating model updates.

3. **Contribute Compute via Proof-of-Compute**  
   Register as a Compute Node by interacting with the deployed contracts, then run your node or service to listen for new AI tasks and submit proofs of computation.

4. **Use the White Box AI Dashboard**  
   Access a web-based dashboard (if implemented) to visualize model decisions, attention maps, and on-chain logs, confirming your device or node is successfully contributing to the network.
